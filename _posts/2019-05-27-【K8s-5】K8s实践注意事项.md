# 注意事项
1. `如果容器1号进程是shell脚本，应用进程是这个shell进程的子进程，那这个shell进程是收不到 SIGTERM 信号的`
   ```
   这种启动方式是Pod配置文件container启动参数的shell脚本，例如 "/bin/sh /run.sh -c ..."，这种方式业务应用进程是通过run.sh脚本启动
   在容器内部，PID为1进程为run.sh，业务进程为1号进程子进程
   
   这种方式有个问题就是，容器内1号是收不到操作系统 SIGTERM 信号的，具体可以参考
   
   Note: A process running as PID 1 inside a container is treated specially by Linux: it ignores any signal with the default action. So, the process will not terminate on SIGINT or SIGTERM unless it is coded to do so.
   One mistake which is pretty common and something which can be missed is using the non-exec form of CMD , for example, then your process is running as a child process of shell and not really running as root. It will be running as /bin/sh -c myapplication
   The problem with this is that, shell will never forward this signal to the child process, which is your application process and it will not be able to handle the SIGTERM for which you have written a handler for.
   In any case, this would make your process be SIGKILLed. Instead one should use the exec form CMD
   ```
